# Tribute Page - Parke's Castle
Created for freecodecamp.org's certificate [Responsive Web Design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/). This is project <b>Build a Tribute Page</b>. Used [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/) to create the responsive design.

For certificate credit, I submitted [CodePen](https://codepen.io/hilbug/full/VwmMPOO). Also deployed to GitHub pages [here](https://hilbug.github.io/freecodecamp-tribute-page/).
